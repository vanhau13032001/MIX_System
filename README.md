# Mix_System
# Description
The Material Mixing System is an application designed to control the process of mixing two types of materials in a mixing tank. The system consists of two material discharge valves, each controlling a separate type of material. The operator can input the weight of each material for each batch. After the materials are discharged into the mixing tank, a mixing motor is activated to mix the materials for a set period of time.

Once the mixing process is completed as per the set time, the system will activate a third valve to discharge the mixed material. This process continues until a low-level sensor detects depletion, at which point the system automatically closes the third valve and completes a batch.

The system also allows for manual control by the operator, enabling them to intervene in the mixing process and control the valves and mixing motor manually.

# Features

 + Order Management:The Order Management feature allows users to efficiently manage orders, including the ability to set order names, specify ingredient quantities, and add, delete, or update orders. The values associated with each order are stored in a SQL Server database.
