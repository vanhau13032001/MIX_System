# Mix_System
# Description
The Material Mixing System is an application designed to control the process of mixing two types of materials in a mixing tank. The system consists of two material discharge valves, each controlling a separate type of material. The operator can input the weight of each material for each batch. After the materials are discharged into the mixing tank, a mixing motor is activated to mix the materials for a set period of time.

Once the mixing process is completed as per the set time, the system will activate a third valve to discharge the mixed material. This process continues until a low-level sensor detects depletion, at which point the system automatically closes the third valve and completes a batch.

The system also allows for manual control by the operator, enabling them to intervene in the mixing process and control the valves and mixing motor manually.
